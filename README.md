# Bad-Spectrogran

This is a real time spectrogram that is poorly made and bairly works. However, there is one thing special about it... IT RUNS ON THE GPU! Thats right, this puppy can perform
a high defenition fast fourier transform in real time using the power of an NVIDA GPU. Though I am not sure how accurate my work is, it does something so I am proud.

Brandon in the future: looking back at my code I now realize that I didnt understand what an FFT was. I was able to compensate for my stupididty by using a GPU.
